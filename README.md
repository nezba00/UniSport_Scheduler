# UniSport_Scheduler
Let's bring UniBe UniSport to the next level with a easy to use Scheduler with many other functions!

## Welcome!❤️
Welcome and thank you for visiting our GitHub repository!

## Goals
### What are we doing here?
The goal of this project is to make the UniBe UniSport website better accessible, and to provide students with a tool to schedule their sports activities based on their availabilities and preferences.

### Why are we working on this Scheduler?
Since students oftentimes have to work besides their studies and sometimes even have frequently changing schedules, planning extra curricular activities can be quite challenging sometimes. Combined with the massive amount of sports offered at the university of bern, choosing a sport can become a tedious process with the software solutions provided at this point in time. 

### How are we planning to achieve this?
In short, by having a programm that handles almost all of it for you. For this, we first want to scrape the UniSport page for information like time, registration requirements, difficulty level, location and short descriptions about every course they offer. This data will then be further completed with information allowing us to give recommendations to users based on their needs, sports history and schedule.

## About us
Our team at this point consists out of 4 master students of the university of bern. All of us are quite new to the coding world and excited to learn more about Python in a practical way. The project we are doing together will be a work for the Advanced Python course. At the same time it is not only meant as an exercise, but as an honest attempt to solve an issue that affects many students at the university of bern.

## Contribute
Thank you for giving this section a visit! Unfortunately at this point there is no way to contribute to this project since it has only just started. Since this project is part of an exercise there will only be limited ways of contributing in the near future. Nonetheless, we would be very happy to know what issues you have faced yet while planning your sport activities. Also we have an extra section in this README.md where you can report bugs if you experience issues with our program. 

Be reassured that one of our first goals is to resolve this issue and you will find information about how to contribute as soon as possible.
