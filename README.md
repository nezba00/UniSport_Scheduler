## Goals
### What are we doing here?
The goal of this project is to make the UniBe UniSport website better accessible, and to provide students with a tool to schedule their sports activities based on their availabilities and preferences.

### Why are we working on this Scheduler?
Since students oftentimes have to work besides their studies and sometimes even have frequently changing schedules, planning extra curricular activities can be quite challenging sometimes. Combined with the massive amount of sports offered at the university of bern, choosing a sport can become a tedious process with the software solutions provided at this point in time. 

### How are we planning to achieve this?
In short, by having a programm that handles almost all of it for you. For this, we first want to scrape the UniSport page for information like time, registration requirements, difficulty level, location and short descriptions about every course they offer. This data will then be further completed with information allowing us to give recommendations to users based on their needs, sports history and schedule.

## About us
Our team at this point consists out of 4 master students of the university of bern. The project we are doing together will be a work for the Advanced Python course.At the same time it is not only meant as an exercise, but as an honest attempt to solve an issue that affects many students at the university of bern.
